# gRPC server in Scala

Small example app for a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) server written in Scala with the help of [ScalaPB](https://github.com/scalapb/ScalaPB).

It spins up the gRPC server so you can execute requests against it under the conditions of the `proto` files under `/protobuf`. An example of a gRPC client written in Scala you can find [here](https://github.com/maoertel/grpc-client). No magic just to see how it works and interacts.
